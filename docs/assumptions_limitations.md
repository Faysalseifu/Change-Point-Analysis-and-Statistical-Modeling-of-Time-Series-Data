## Assumptions and Limitations (Task 1)

### Assumptions
- Data is complete and accurate; daily closes reflect market conditions.
- Log returns are approximately stationary and suitable for modeling.
- Discrete change points dominate regime shifts in the study window.
- Weakly informative priors allow data to drive inference.
- Temporal proximity between events and change points suggests association (not causation).

### Limitations
- Change point detection identifies statistical breaks, not causal mechanisms.
- Single-change models may miss multiple or gradual regime shifts.
- Confounders (e.g., demand shifts, shale supply, weather) can drive changes independently of events.
- Focus on 2012–2022 omits longer cycles.
- Daily data does not capture intraday volatility or microstructure effects.
